### Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. You may notice build errors when you attempt to build/start the app for the first time. This is by design, the compile-time errors should describe what is missing. Completing Tasks 1 & 2 will resolve this.

### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
